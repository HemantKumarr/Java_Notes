Hashmap - Unordered collection - not thread safe - Imp Interview topic
It can store single null value as a key. They can have duplicate values but not duplicate keys.

LinkedHashmap - preserves insertion order hence ordered collection
ConcurrentHashmap - thread safe

In hashmap when we insert any value first its hash is generated, then it is inserted in hashtable. If there already exists any value for that hash then both
the keys are compared based on equals are method which can be default implementation of Object class or Overridden in child class.

By default for java if 2 object are pointing to same address/reference then they are equal (Object.equal() method). Hence we override the default implementation
of equals method in our class and compare two objects based on their field values as two different object pointing to different address can have the same values.
