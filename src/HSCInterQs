IoC principle

Java IO vs NIO

Java IO 	                                Java NIO
Java IO stands for Java Input Output 	    Java NIO stands for Java New Input Output
Java IO operates inside java.io package 	Java NIO operates inside java.nio package
Java IO is Stream oriented 	                Java NIO is Buffer oriented
Blocking IO operation 	                    Non-blocking IO operation
Channels are not available 	                Channels are available
It deals with data in stream 	            It deals with data in blocks

vector vs arraylist
ArrayList is fast since it is not synchronized. ArrayList performance is high . Multiple threads is allowed
Vector performance is low since it is synchronized. only one threads are allowed .

eager vs lazy loading


Integer num1 = 100;
        Integer num2 = 100;
        Integer num3 = 128;
        Integer num4 = 128;
 num1 = num2 but num3 != num4
because For values within the range of -128 to 127, Java uses a cache for Integer objects to optimize memory usage. When comparing two Integer objects within this range, the “==” operator will return true if they have the same value, as they are referring to the same cached object.

However, for values outside this range, Java creates separate Integer objects for each value. When comparing two Integer objects outside the range of -128 to 127 using the “==” operator, it will return false, even if they have the same value. This is because they are distinct objects in memory.
