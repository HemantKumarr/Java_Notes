For select query we use executeQuery() method which returns data of ResultSet type.
A ResultSet cursor is initially positioned before first row. It is of 3 types
    TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY (default type).
Type_Scroll_insensitive and sensitive - sensitive to the changes in the data in resultSet

ResultSet.Concur_Read_Only - when we only want to read the data and to update anything in the result set.
For insert, update and delete we use executeUpdate() method.
