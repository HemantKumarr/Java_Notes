// No. Static methods in Java cannot be overridden. This is because static methods are not associated with the instance of a class, but with the class itself.
// Therefore, when a subclass inherits a static method from its parent class, it cannot modify the behavior of the static method in any way
// The following are some important points for method overriding and static methods in Java.
//     For class (or static) methods, the method according to the type of reference is called, not according to the object being referred, which means method call is decided at compile time.
//     For instance (or non-static) methods, the method is called according to the type of object being referred, not according to the type of reference, which means method calls is decided at run time.
//     An instance (or non-static) method cannot override a static method, and a static method cannot hide an instance (or non-static) method. Throws compiler errors. i.e. a static method in parent class must be declared as static in child class also and a non-static method must be declared as non-static in child class.
//     In a subclass (or Derived Class), we can overload the static methods inherited from the superclass. Such overloaded methods neither hide nor override the superclass methods â€” they are new methods, unique to the subclass.
